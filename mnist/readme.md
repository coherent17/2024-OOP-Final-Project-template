# MNIST Dataset Files Overview

The MNIST dataset consists of four primary files:

1. **train-images.idx3-ubyte**: This file contains the training images for the MNIST dataset. Each image is represented as a 28x28 grayscale image, totaling 784 pixels. The file format includes a header specifying the number of images, followed by the pixel values for each image.

2. **train-labels.idx1-ubyte**: This file contains the corresponding labels for the training images. Each label represents the digit (0-9) that the corresponding image represents. The file format includes a header specifying the number of labels, followed by the label for each image.

3. **t10k-images.idx3-ubyte**: This file contains the test images for the MNIST dataset. Similar to the training images, each test image is represented as a 28x28 grayscale image with a total of 784 pixels. The file format includes a header specifying the number of images, followed by the pixel values for each image.

4. **t10k-labels.idx1-ubyte**: This file contains the corresponding labels for the test images. Each label represents the digit (0-9) that the corresponding test image represents. Similar to the training labels file, the format includes a header specifying the number of labels, followed by the label for each test image.

## File Format
The data in these files is stored in a binary format. Each file begins with a header section that specifies metadata such as the number of images or labels contained in the file. Following the header, the actual data is stored in a structured format according to the specifications mentioned above. It's essential to parse these files correctly to extract the image data and corresponding labels for training and testing machine learning models.
